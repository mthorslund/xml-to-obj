This repo contains a PHP 5 utility class along with some sample data and 
examples.

The purpose of the class is to read an XML file (could be configuration
settings, or some exported data from an external system) and map that to a 
number of existing PHP classes. This uses PHP's SimpleXMLElement class. I think 
the code shows a pretty flexible and reusable approach, though I don't imagine 
I'm the first one to invent something like this. The only expectation of the 
existing PHP classes is that they implement a "factory" method I chose to call 
"create": That method should take my ElementWrapper object as an argument, 
instantiate the PHP class and return the resulting object.

I don't know about performance, as I haven't had the need to test this. I use 
the same technique as a part of my build process, which is not a run-time 
operation. So I just put that disclaimer there in case it performs horribly 
under stress.
